# Driver Interface Fix - Today's Summary & History Tab

## Date: October 6, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Today's Summary Not Working**
**Problem**: Trips and Earnings showed 0 even when driver had completed trips today.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `getActiveBookings()` function only returned bookings with status "PENDING", "ACCEPTED", and "IN_PROGRESS"
- It excluded "COMPLETED" bookings, which are needed to calculate today's statistics

**Solution**:
- Modified `getActiveBookings()` in `FirebaseRealtimeDatabaseService.kt` to include "COMPLETED" status
- Changed line 188: Added "COMPLETED" to the status filter
- Now fetches: `listOf("PENDING", "ACCEPTED", "IN_PROGRESS", "COMPLETED")`

### 2. **History Tab Empty**
**Problem**: The History tab showed "No trip history" even when driver had completed trips.

**Root Cause**:
- `completedBookings` filter only checked `assignedDriverId`
- It didn't check `driverRFID`, which is the primary identifier in your database
- COMPLETED bookings weren't being loaded (same root cause as issue #1)

**Solution**:
- Updated the `completedBookings` filter in `DriverInterface.kt` (line 130-140)
- Now checks BOTH `driverRFID` and `assignedDriverId` for matching
- Same logic as used for active bookings filtering

## Code Changes

### File 1: `FirebaseRealtimeDatabaseService.kt`

**Before:**
```kotlin
if (booking.status in listOf("PENDING", "ACCEPTED", "IN_PROGRESS")) {
    bookings.add(booking)
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
if (booking.status in listOf("PENDING", "ACCEPTED", "IN_PROGRESS", "COMPLETED")) {
    bookings.add(booking)
}
```

### File 2: `DriverInterface.kt`

**Before:**
```kotlin
val completedBookings = activeBookings.filter { booking ->
    booking.assignedDriverId == user.id && booking.status == BookingStatus.COMPLETED
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
val completedBookings = activeBookings.filter { booking ->
    val isMyBooking = (booking.driverRFID == driverRFID && driverRFID.isNotEmpty()) ||
                     (booking.assignedDriverId == user.id)
    val isCompleted = booking.status == BookingStatus.COMPLETED
    
    val result = isMyBooking && isCompleted
    
    if (result) {
        println("✓ Found completed booking ${booking.id} for driver $driverRFID")
    }
    
    result
}
```

## What Now Works

### ✅ Today's Summary Card
- **Trips**: Shows actual count of completed trips today
- **Earnings**: Shows total fare from completed trips today
- **Calculation**: 
  - Filters bookings by driver (using RFID or driverID)
  - Only counts COMPLETED status
  - Only counts trips from today (after midnight)
  - Sums up actualFare (or estimatedFare as fallback)

### ✅ History Tab
- **Displays**: All completed bookings for the driver
- **Matching**: Uses both driverRFID and assignedDriverId
- **Shows**: Customer name, date, time, fare, pickup/dropoff locations
- **Sorted**: Most recent bookings first
- **Real-time**: Updates automatically when trips are completed

## Testing Checklist

1. ✅ **Complete a test trip**:
   - Accept a booking
   - Start trip (IN_PROGRESS)
   - Complete trip (COMPLETED)
   
2. ✅ **Check Today's Summary**:
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Should show "1" in Trips
   - Should show the fare amount in Earnings
   
3. ✅ **Check History Tab**:
   - Go to History tab
   - Should see the completed trip listed
   - Should show customer name, locations, and fare

4. ✅ **Check with multiple trips**:
   - Complete multiple trips today
   - Today's Summary should show total count and sum of earnings
   - History should show all completed trips

## Debug Logging

The code includes debug prints to help troubleshoot:

```
✓ Found completed booking {id} for driver {RFID}
Today's stats: X trips, ₱Y earnings
Found completed trip: fare=₱Z, timestamp={timestamp}
```

Check Logcat for these messages to verify trips are being counted correctly.

## Database Structure Compatibility

The fix works with your existing database structure:
- **bookings** table with fields: `driverRFID`, `assignedDriverId`, `status`, `timestamp`, `estimatedFare`, `actualFare`
- **drivers** table with field: `rfidUID`

No database migration needed - it works with existing data!
