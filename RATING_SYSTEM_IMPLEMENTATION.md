# Rating System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a 5-star rating system with feedback textbox to the Customer Interface booking history cards. Customers can now rate their completed trips and provide feedback.

## Changes Made

### 1. Models.kt
**Location:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/toda/data/Models.kt`

**Added:**
- `Rating` data class with the following fields:
  - `id`: Unique rating identifier
  - `bookingId`: Reference to the booking
  - `customerId` and `customerName`: Customer information
  - `driverId` and `driverName`: Driver information
  - `stars`: Rating value (1-5)
  - `feedback`: Optional feedback text
  - `timestamp`: When the rating was submitted
  - `ratedBy`: Who submitted the rating ("CUSTOMER" or "DRIVER")

### 2. EnhancedBookingViewModel.kt
**Location:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/toda/viewmodel/EnhancedBookingViewModel.kt`

**Added:**
- `submitRating()` function that takes:
  - `bookingId`: The booking to rate
  - `stars`: Rating value (1-5)
  - `feedback`: Optional feedback text
- This function calls the existing `repository.updateRating()` method

### 3. CustomerInterface.kt
**Location:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/toda/ui/customer/CustomerInterface.kt`

**Updated `BookingHistoryCard` composable to include:**

#### Rating UI Components:
1. **5-Star Rating System**
   - Displayed horizontally with centered alignment
   - Clickable star icons that fill with gold color when selected
   - Users can select 1-5 stars

2. **Feedback TextField**
   - Multi-line text input (3-5 lines)
   - Optional - users can submit rating with or without feedback
   - Placeholder text: "Share your experience..."
   - Label: "Feedback (Optional)"

3. **Submit Button**
   - Only enabled when at least 1 star is selected
   - Shows loading indicator while submitting
   - Changes text from "Submit Rating" to "Submitting..." during submission

4. **Thank You Message**
   - Displayed after successful rating submission
   - Shows green checkmark icon with "Thank you for your feedback!" message
   - Replaces the rating form after submission

#### Features:
- **Conditional Display**: Rating section only appears for COMPLETED bookings
- **Driver Information**: Shows driver name if available
- **State Management**: 
  - Tracks selected stars
  - Manages feedback text
  - Handles submission state (loading)
  - Prevents double submission
- **Error Handling**: Logs errors to console if submission fails

## Backend Integration

The rating system uses existing backend infrastructure:

### Repository Layer
- `TODARepository.updateRating()` - Already implemented
- Parameters: `bookingId`, `stars`, `feedback`
- Returns: `Result<Unit>`

### Firebase Service
- `FirebaseRealtimeDatabaseService.updateRating()` - Already implemented
- Updates the `/ratings/{ratingId}` node in Firebase
- Sets `ratedBy` to "CUSTOMER" to distinguish from driver ratings

### Database Structure
Ratings are stored in Firebase under `/ratings/` with this structure:
```json
{
  "ratings": {
    "{ratingId}": {
      "id": "{ratingId}",
      "bookingId": "{bookingId}",
      "customerId": "{customerId}",
      "customerName": "Customer Name",
      "driverId": "{driverId}",
      "driverName": "Driver Name",
      "stars": 5,
      "feedback": "Great service!",
      "timestamp": 1234567890,
      "ratedBy": "CUSTOMER"
    }
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

1. Customer completes a booking
2. Booking appears in "History" tab with COMPLETED status
3. Rating section appears below booking details
4. Customer clicks stars to select rating (1-5)
5. Customer optionally enters feedback in text field
6. Customer clicks "Submit Rating" button
7. System submits rating to Firebase
8. Thank you message appears, replacing the rating form
9. Rating is stored and can be used for driver performance metrics

## Visual Design

- **Stars**: Gold color (#FFD700) when selected, gray when unselected
- **Layout**: Centered star row, full-width feedback field
- **Spacing**: Proper padding and spacing between elements
- **Cards**: Uses Material 3 design with proper elevation
- **Status Badge**: Green for COMPLETED, Red for CANCELLED
- **Divider**: Separates rating section from booking details

## Testing Recommendations

1. Complete a booking and verify it appears in history
2. Check that rating section only appears for COMPLETED bookings
3. Test star selection (clicking stars 1-5)
4. Test feedback text input
5. Verify submit button is disabled until stars are selected
6. Test rating submission and verify success message
7. Check Firebase database for rating entry
8. Verify rating cannot be submitted twice (UI shows thank you message)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Display existing rating if already submitted (read from Firebase)
- Allow editing of submitted ratings within a time window
- Show average driver rating on booking cards
- Add rating statistics to driver dashboard
- Implement notification to driver when rated
- Add rating filters in booking history
