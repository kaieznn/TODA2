# Driver Interface Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the Driver Interface to display booking history and contributions using your existing database structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Firebase Service Updates** (`FirebaseRealtimeDatabaseService.kt`)

#### Updated `getDriverContributions()`
- Now queries contributions by `driverRFID` instead of `driverId`
- Converts timestamp from seconds to milliseconds
- Maps your database structure to `FirebaseContribution` model:
  - `amount` - contribution amount
  - `date` - contribution date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - `timestamp` - converted to milliseconds
  - `driverName` - driver's name
  - `todaNumber` - TODA organization number

#### Updated `getDriverTodayStats()`
- Fetches driver's RFID first
- Queries all bookings and filters by:
  - `driverRFID` (primary match)
  - `assignedDriverId` (fallback match)
  - `status == "COMPLETED"`
  - `timestamp >= today's start`
- Calculates:
  - Today's trips count
  - Today's earnings (uses `actualFare` if available, else `estimatedFare`)
  - Driver rating (currently defaults to 5.0)

### 2. **Driver Interface Updates** (`DriverInterface.kt`)

#### History Tab
- Displays completed bookings for the driver
- Shows:
  - Customer name and booking date/time
  - Fare amount
  - Pickup and dropoff locations
  - TODA number and verification code
- Filters bookings where:
  - `assignedDriverId == current driver's ID`
  - `status == COMPLETED`
- Empty state when no history exists

#### Contributions Tab
- Uses existing `DriverContributionsScreen` component
- Displays contribution history with filters:
  - All, Today, This Week, This Month
- Shows contribution summary:
  - Total contributions
  - Today's contributions
  - This month's contributions
  - Contribution count and streak

#### Today's Summary Card (Dashboard)
- **Trips**: Count of completed trips today
- **Earnings**: Total earnings from completed trips today
- **Rating**: Driver rating (currently 5.0 default)
- Updates in real-time from Firebase

## How It Works

### Online Status
- Driver is **ONLINE** if they have made a contribution today
- Checked by querying `contributions` table for today's date
- Online status is **read-only** (based on contributions, not a toggle)

### Booking History
- Fetches from `bookings` table
- Matches bookings by `assignedDriverId` or `driverRFID`
- Only shows COMPLETED bookings
- Sorted by timestamp (most recent first)

### Contributions History
- Fetches from `contributions` table
- Matches by `driverRFID` (looks up RFID from `drivers` table first)
- Displays:
  - Amount
  - Date
  - TODA number
  - Timestamp

### Today's Summary
- Queries all bookings in real-time
- Filters by driver and COMPLETED status
- Calculates trips and earnings for today only
- Updates automatically when new trips are completed

## Database Fields Used

### From `contributions` table:
```
amount: Double
date: String (YYYY-MM-DD)
timestamp: String (Unix timestamp in seconds)
driverName: String
driverRFID: String
todaNumber: String
```

### From `bookings` table:
```
id: String
customerId: String
customerName: String
pickupLocation: String
destination: String
estimatedFare: Double
actualFare: Double
status: String
timestamp: Long
assignedDriverId: String
driverRFID: String
todaNumber: String
verificationCode: String
```

## Testing the Changes

1. **Test Contributions Tab**:
   - Log in as a driver
   - Go to "Contributions" tab
   - Should see all contributions made by that driver
   - Try different filters (Today, This Week, etc.)

2. **Test History Tab**:
   - Go to "History" tab
   - Should see all completed bookings
   - Verify pickup/dropoff locations and fares are correct

3. **Test Today's Summary**:
   - Check the Dashboard
   - "Trips" should show count of completed trips today
   - "Earnings" should show total earnings today
   - Values update when you complete a trip

4. **Test Online Status**:
   - Driver shows "Online" if contributed today
   - Driver shows "Offline" if no contribution today
   - Status indicator appears in top bar (green = online, gray = offline)

## Notes

- All queries use `driverRFID` for consistency with your hardware system
- Timestamps are converted from seconds to milliseconds automatically
- Empty states are shown when no data exists
- All data updates in real-time from Firebase
- The system handles both `assignedDriverId` and `driverRFID` for backward compatibility

## Future Enhancements

1. Add actual driver rating calculation from booking ratings
2. Add date range filter for history
3. Add export functionality for contributions and bookings
4. Add search functionality in history
5. Add booking details modal with more information
